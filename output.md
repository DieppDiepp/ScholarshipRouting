## PROJECTS

## Nông Trí AI - Smart Agriculture Chatbot

Jan - Mar 2025

Developing an intelligent chatbot utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to support farmers, especially with knowledge about coffee, pepper, and durian. The system integrates advanced Vietnamese embeddings and an optimized, multi-branch parallel RAG pipeline.

- Vietnamese Embedding: Optimized text representation using the vietnamese-embedding model.
- RAG Pipeline: Built an end-to-end RAG pipeline for question reformulation and contextual retrieval, with multi RAG optimization techniques like multi-queries, routing database,...
- Tech Stack: FastAPI, ChromaDB, Langchain, Langsmith, Hugging Face models, Netlify, Windows/Linux server hosting.
- Deployment:
- -Product Introduction: nongtri.netlify.app
- -Chatbot Demo: nongtrichat.netlify.app

## Black-Scholes Model In Options Pricing Finance

Oct - Dec 2024

Essay in Advanced Probability and Statistics Course: Explain the mathematical basis of the Black-Scholes model using Brownian motion, stochastic differential equations, Ito's lemma, and economic knowledge of options and derivatives markets

- Responsible for Part II of the report: Stochastic Differential Equations SDEs

## Analysis of ICT Recruitment Trends and Development of a Recommendation System

Mar - June 2025

Conducted research, collection, and analysis of a large dataset of ICT job postings to identify trends, and built an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.

- Built and deployed an automated data scraping system using Selenium and BeautifulSoup on a VPS to collect over 4,000 job postings from websites such as TopCV , integrating anti-bot mechanisms like IP rotation and request throttling, and developed a module to automatically retry failed requests, ensuring data integrity.
- Performed comprehensive data analysis, from organizing the raw data to building an interactive dashboard with Power BI to visualize key recruitment trends.
- Conducted foundational research on the ICT job market and existing recommendation systems to define the project's scope and objectives.

## Modeling Insulin-Glucose Interaction to Ensure Stability and Homeostasis

Aug 2024

Developing a model that represents the interaction between insulin and glucose, ensuring stability and reflecting the body's homeostasis. The model should control glucose primarily through insulin and be personalized for at least one patient based on meal data and blood glucose levels.

- Researching factors related to glucose concentration and the two types of diabetes.
- Used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to predict glucose concentration dependence on related hormones, improving model accuracy by including glucagon.
- Developed a second model using a sigmoid function to represent glucose from food, showing a better fit with real data compared to the original model.
