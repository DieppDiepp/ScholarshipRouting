This generous financial aid policy is applied equally to international students as it is to domestic students. The undergraduate financial aid budget for the 2022-23 academic year was $217.4 million, reflecting Princeton's commitment to accessibility.\n\nKey Funding Details:\n*   Grant-Based Aid: Financial aid packages consist entirely of grants, eliminating the need for student loans. Princeton Parent Loans (PPL) are available for families wishing to finance their expected contribution.\n*   Income Tiers for Undergraduates:\n    *   Most families with incomes under $100,000 qualify for grant aid covering full tuition, room, books, and personal expenses.\n    *   Families with incomes up to $150,000 a year may pay nothing for their student to attend.\n    *   Many families with incomes up to $250,000 receive aid to cover the full cost of tuition.\n    *   Families with incomes up to and even beyond $350,000 (especially those with multiple children in college) may also receive significant grant aid.\n*   Graduate Student Support: All Ph.D. and many master's degree candidates in the Princeton Graduate School receive financial support for the duration of their degree program.
