If a student changes enrolment from a doctoral program to a masters by research program, support is limited to a maximum duration of two years full-time equivalent, including any time already spent in the doctoral program.\n\n## Timeline and Duration\n\nApplication periods and deadlines for RTP scholarships vary significantly by university, typically occurring once or twice a year.\n\n*   **Application Opening Dates:** For instance, Federation University's 2026 RTP stipend scholarships open on 1 September 2025.\n*   **Application Deadlines:**\n    *   International students applying for Round 1 (commencing January-March of the following year) at ANU are required to apply for admission by 31 August.\n    *   Federation University's 2026 RTP stipend scholarships close at 11:59 PM on the 31st of an unspecified month (likely September or October, given the opening date).\n*   **Commencement:** Round 1 commencements are generally from January through to the end of March of the following year.\n*   **Number of Awards:** The exact number of RTP scholarships awarded each year is not centrally specified but is determined by individual universities based on the funding they receive from the Australian Government. Universities award scholarships based on competitive ranking processes.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\nThe RTP Scholarship is open to both domestic and international students who are undertaking a Research Doctorate or Research Masters degree (Higher Degree by Research - HDR) at an eligible Australian university.\n\n**General Eligibility:**\n*   Candidates must be of high quality and demonstrate strong research potential.\n*   Applicants can be new to a program or current students (typically enrolled for less than a year full-time equivalent).\n*   All RTP Scholarship students must be enrolled (without suspension) in a current HDR course to receive support.\n*   Work commitments are generally not accepted as grounds for an extension of the scholarship duration.\n*   The scholarship is available to students undertaking Joint Research Awards when an Australian university (e.g., Monash University) is the home institution.\n*   Applicants may need to be nominated by an enrolling school or institute (e.g., at UQ).\n*   Some universities, like UNE, normally offer stipend scholarships subject to enrolment as a full-time, on-campus student for the duration of candidature.\n\n**Domestic Students Specifics:**\n*   Domestic students are eligible for a full RTP Fees Offset if they have not used any RTP Fees Offset or Research Training Scheme funding in the previous three years at any Australian university, or if they have already used such funding and successfully completed an HDR program.\n\n## Field Restrictions\n\nRTP scholarships are broadly available across various disciplines.\n*   Some universities, like the University of Tasmania (UTAS), state that scholarships are available in \"all fields of study.\"\n*   Other universities, such as ACU and ANU, specify that research must align with the university's broad areas of expertise or research strategy. Applicants are encouraged to ensure their proposed research fits within the strategic priorities of their chosen institution.\n\n## Academic Requirements\n\nSecuring an RTP Scholarship is highly competitive, demanding exceptional academic achievement.\n*   **Minimum Academic Standing:** Applicants typically need to demonstrate very high academic achievement, often equivalent to a first-class honours bachelor's degree or a relevant Master's degree with very good grades.\n*   **GPA Expectations:** Some universities mention a minimum GPA of 6.0 or above on a 7-point scale or equivalent. However, for competitive fields, a perfect or very close to perfect GPA is often required to stand a strong chance.\n*   **Required Degree:** The scholarship supports students undertaking a Research Doctorate, Research Masters, Masters by Research, PhD, or a research-focused professional doctorate.\n\n## Experience Requirements\n\nWhile not always specified in terms of minimum years, relevant research experience is a significant factor.\n*   **Accepted Types:** Applicants are generally expected to have at least six months of relevant supervised research experience with outstanding results, often gained as part of a Master's degree.\n*   **Research Internships:** Research internships are also recognized, with universities required to publicly set out arrangements for such internships, addressing impacts on RTP stipend rates and duration as part of their RTP Scholarship Policy.\n\n## Test Requirements\n\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** All applicants must meet the specific English language proficiency requirements of their chosen university for enrolment in a research degree. These requirements vary by institution.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n\nBeyond academic and research experience, several other factors contribute to a successful RTP application:\n*   **Reference Letters:** Strong referee letters are crucial, preferably from academics who have supervised the applicant's previous research.\n*   **Supervisor and Resources:** Confirmation of a qualified supervisor, available space, and necessary resources within the university is a prerequisite for scholarship consideration.\n*   **Research Environment:** The suitability of the research environment is often a consideration in the selection process.\n*   **Distinguishing Factors:** Applicants are encouraged to highlight achievements that make them stand out, such as authorship of a peer-reviewed journal paper (especially in a well-regarded journal), or notable academic prizes and commendations.\n*   **Academic Ethic:** Academic achievement and/or ethic during the most relevant qualification are also considered.\n\n## Background and Logistics\n\nThe RTP is the principal Commonwealth Government program supporting promising researchers in Australia, making it one of the most prominent and competitive funding options for HDR students.\n\n*   **Official Website:** The primary government resource for the program is https://www.education.gov.au/research-block-grants/research-training-program.\n*   **Application Process:** Universities are entirely responsible for their own application, selection, and offer processes for RTP scholarships.\n    *   Prospective students must contact their chosen eligible university's postgraduate research office directly to discuss application procedures, required documents, and specific deadlines.\n    *   Many universities automatically consider eligible applicants for scholarships when they apply for course admission. However, some may require a separate scholarship application form (e.g., an 'online graduate research application for Scholarship Only' for current students or those with an offer).\n    *   Documents required will be specified on the chosen university's 'How to Apply' webpage.\n*   **Selection Process:** Selection is highly competitive and merit-based. Universities rank candidates based on:\n    *   Academic merit and results for prior study.\n    *   Demonstrated research potential.\n    *   Alignment of the proposed research with the university's research strategy.\n    *   Confirmation of a qualified supervisor and the availability of space and resources.\n*   **Timeline Summary:** Application periods are typically once or twice a year, with Round 1 commencements usually scheduled for January to March of the following year. Given the decentralized nature, applicants must consult their target university for precise dates.",
