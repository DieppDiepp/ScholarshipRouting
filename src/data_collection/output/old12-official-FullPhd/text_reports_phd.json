Eligibility Criteria\n\nApplicants must meet specific criteria to be considered for a Chevening Scholarship.\n*   **General Eligibility:** Applicants must meet the general eligibility criteria outlined by Chevening.\n*   **Restrictions on Affiliation:** Strict restrictions apply to individuals with recent ties to His Majesty’s Government (HMG) or related organizations.

However, enrolling in a pre-sessional course to meet a university offer condition will render the Chevening award no longer tenable for that specific course.

The funding package typically includes:\n\n*   **Tuition Fees:** Full coverage of UK tuition fees, with maximum amounts specified as £4,786 per year, or £5,006 per year in some cases.\n*   **Stipend:** A living stipend provided at the standard UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) rate.\n*   **Research Support Training Grant (RTSG):** An annual grant of £1,000 to support research training activities.\n*   **Conference Fees:** Coverage for conference attendance, facilitating dissemination of research and networking.\n*   **International Fee Support:** Crucially, some DTPs, such as the University of Edinburgh's E5 DTP, explicitly cover the difference between Home and International fees for eligible international applicants, removing a significant financial barrier.\n\nBeyond direct financial support, DTPs also offer flexibility in awards and may fund up to 15 Vacation Internships per year from a university's DTP allocation, averaged over the grant duration.\n\n## Timeline Information\n\nThe application and award timelines for UKRI DTPs are highly variable, as each DTP operates with its own specific schedule. Prospective students are strongly advised to contact the relevant DTP directly for precise dates.\n\n*   **Application Deadlines:** These vary significantly, with examples including November 18, 2025 (8:00 PM ET for one opportunity), January 17, 2025 (for Techne DTP), January 16, 2025 (for MRC stage two round seven), and early January (for CENTA applications starting in October).\n*   **Opening Dates:** Similarly, opening dates are DTP-specific. Examples include November 1, 2024 (for MRC stage two round seven) and January 21, 2026 (3:00 PM for the International Placement Scheme 2026, which may be related).\n*   **Number of Awards:** The number of studentships varies by DTP. For instance, IAPETUS2 plans to support at least 13 funded postgraduate studentships for its 2026 cohort, while another DTP offers 45 studentships annually (comprising 5 standard and 4 iCASE studentships). A key restriction is that UKRI caps international studentships at 30% of the total number of studentships awarded by a DTP each year.\n*   **Program Dates & Duration:** Studentships typically commence in October (e.g., October 1, 2025, for Techne DTP; October 2024 for a NERC cohort). The standard duration for DTP studentships is 3.5 years, or its part-time equivalent. Some opportunities may have program dates extending into Summer 2026.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\nUKRI DTP studentships are open to a broad range of applicants, reflecting a commitment to attracting diverse talent.\n\n*   **Citizenship and Residency:** From the 2021-22 academic year onwards, UKRI studentships are open to international students, including EU applicants. Applicants of all citizenships and fee statuses are eligible, provided they meet the specific PhD entry requirements of the host university/DTP.\n*   **Home Student Status:** To be classified as a 'home student' for fee purposes, applicants must either be a UK National (meeting specific residency requirements) or possess settled status in the UK. Candidates who do not meet these criteria are considered international students.\n*   **Application Process:** Prospective students must apply directly to a specific DTP or Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT). Each DTP/CDT is responsible for its internal selection processes and for determining student eligibility for funding, strictly adhering to UK government regulations concerning residential eligibility.\n\n## Field Restrictions\n\nThe eligible fields of study are determined by the specific DTP and the funding council providing the grant.\n\n*   **Broad Coverage:** DTPs cover a wide range of disciplines, including the full spectrum of social sciences (ESRC) and arts and humanities (AHRC). Other fields covered by the various UKRI councils (EPSRC, MRC, NERC, STFC) are also supported.\n*   **International Student Cap:** A significant restriction is the UKRI-imposed cap on international studentships, which cannot exceed 30% of the total number of studentships awarded by any given DTP each year.\n\n## Academic Requirements\n\nApplicants must demonstrate a strong academic background to be considered for a UKRI DTP studentship.\n\n*   **Minimum Degree:** Candidates are generally required to hold an honours degree at a first or upper second-class level, or a master's degree from a UK academic research organisation.\n*   **University/DTP Specific Requirements:** Beyond these general guidelines, applicants must also satisfy the specific PhD entry requirements set by the individual host university and DTP.\n\n## Experience Requirements\n\nWhile not always a strict prerequisite, relevant experience is considered during the application process.\n\n*   **Work Experience:** Applicants may be asked to provide their employment history for the last three years and detail any relevant work experience. This section typically has a maximum character limit (e.g., 7000 characters with spaces).\n\n## Test Requirements\n\nEnglish language proficiency is essential for study in the UK.\n\n*   **English Language Tests:** While English Language Test results may not be strictly required at the initial application stage, they are typically necessary by the interview stage. Failure to provide these results by the interview may result in only a conditional funding offer being issued.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n\n*   **PhD Entry Requirements:** A fundamental requirement for all applicants is meeting the specific PhD entry criteria established by the chosen university and DTP.\n\n## Background and Logistics\n\n*   **Official Website:** Further general information about UKRI's commitment to developing people and skills can be found at https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/.\n*   **Application Documents:** Required application documents may include a detailed employment history for the past three years and relevant work experience. English Language Test results, if not submitted initially, will be required by the interview stage.\n*   **Selection Process:** The selection process is decentralized. Prospective students must apply directly to their chosen DTP or CDT. Each partnership has its own rigorous internal processes for selecting students and determining funding eligibility, all in accordance with UK government regulations on residential eligibility. Recruitment processes vary significantly between DTPs.\n*   **Scholarship Information:** UKRI DTPs are designed to provide high-quality and coherent postgraduate training through flexible awards. The typical duration of these studentships is 3.5 years, or the part-time equivalent.\n*   **Timeline Summary:** Studentships commonly begin in October. For example, the Techne DTP has a start date of October 1, 2025, and a NERC cohort started in October 2024. Some specific program dates may extend into Summer 2026.",
