This is a significant change from the experience in all decades through the 80s, when most U.S. Rhodes Scholars pursued second B.A. degrees at Oxford. For a general description of the available Oxford degrees, and more information describing the tutorial system, please review the Scholarship information section on the U.S. Rhodes Scholarship website, www.rhodesscholar.org, and the Rhodes Trust website, www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk, and the Undergraduate and Graduate Prospectuses, also available on the web."}
