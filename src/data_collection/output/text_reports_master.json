Eligibility Criteria\n\nThe RTP Scholarship is open to a broad range of candidates, with specific conditions set by both the Australian Government and individual universities.\n\n*   **General Eligibility:**\n    *   Open to both domestic and international students.\n    *   Applicants must be undertaking a Research Doctorate or Research Masters degree (Higher Degree by Research - HDR) at an eligible Australian university.\n    *   Applicants must be enrolled in or have a current offer for admission to an HDR program.\n    *   Students who have not used any RTP Fees Offset or Research Training Scheme funding in the previous three years at any Australian University, or have already used the RTP Fees Offset funding and have successfully completed an HDR Program, are eligible for a full RTP Fees Offset Scholarship.\n    *   Applicants must be enrolled in an accredited course of study at an Australian Higher Education Provider.\n*   **University Discretion:** Universities (HEPs) have discretion to apply additional selection criteria, including prioritising specific cohorts of students. This may include:\n    *   Prioritising students undertaking an HDR for the first time.\n    *   Considering students who commenced their HDR in the previous year but were unable to apply due to timing, or who terminated enrolment within six months of commencement (e.g., Flinders University).\n\n## 5. Field Restrictions\n\nThe RTP Scholarship supports research across a wide array of disciplines, provided the proposed research aligns with the university's strategic priorities and available expertise.\n\n*   **Eligible Fields:** Research Doctorate and Research Masters degrees (Higher Degree by Research - HDR) in areas aligned with the university's research strategy and expertise.\n*   **Restrictions:** There are no overarching field restrictions beyond the requirement that the research aligns with the university's research strategy and that a qualified supervisor, space, and resources are available.\n\n## 6. Academic Requirements\n\nThe RTP Scholarship is highly competitive, demanding a strong academic record from applicants.\n\n*   **Minimum GPA/Academic Achievement:**\n    *   Highly competitive, typically requiring a very high GPA or academic achievement, often equivalent to first-class honours.\n    *   Applicants are ranked based on merit-based selection criteria.\n    *   Anecdotal evidence suggests that without a perfect (or very close to it) GPA, the chances of securing an RTP scholarship can be very low in some fields.\n    *   The GPA used for scholarship assessment is typically based on the applicant's most recent academic qualification.\n*   **Required Degree:** Completion of a degree with a substantial research component (at least 25%), such as an Honours degree or higher, or equivalent international qualifications recognised by Australian tertiary admission authorities. This is a prerequisite for admission to a Research Doctorate or Research Masters degree.\n\n## 7. Experience Requirements\n\nThe collected evidence does not specify minimum years of professional or research experience, nor does it detail accepted types of experience as a universal requirement for the RTP Scholarship. However, a strong research background, often demonstrated through the \"substantial research component\" of a prior degree, is implicitly valued.\n\n## 8. Test Requirements\n\n*   **English Language Proficiency:** English language proficiency requirements apply and are determined by the individual university. Applicants must contact their chosen HEP to ascertain specific IELTS, TOEFL, or other language certificate requirements.\n\n## 9.

Other universities, like Monash, automatically consider eligible applicants for all available graduate research scholarships.\n    *   **Current HDR Students:** May need to submit a separate scholarship application by a specific deadline to be considered (e.g., ANU, Curtin).\n    *   **Supervisor Requirement:** Some universities, such as Curtin, require applicants to obtain an \"Invitation to Apply\" from a registered supervisor as a first step. ANU also mentions the need for confirmation of a qualified supervisor.\n    *   **Enrolment Deadline:** Successful scholarship recipients must enrol in an HDR course by a specified deadline (e.g., March of the following year at Curtin).\n    *   **CHESSN:** Domestic students may be required to have a Commonwealth Higher Education Student Support Number (CHESSN) for RTP eligibility (e.g., Curtin).\n    *   **Joint Research Awards:** Students undertaking Joint Research Awards may be eligible if Monash University is the home institution.\n\n## 10. Background and Logistics\n\nThe RTP Scholarship is a cornerstone of Australia's research training landscape, replacing previous schemes like the Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA).\n\n*   **Official Website:** The primary government resource for the RTP is the Department of Education website: https://www.education.gov.au/research-block-grants/research-training-program. However, for application details, students must contact their chosen university.\n*   **Application Documents:** Required documents are determined by the individual university. Prospective applicants should contact the postgraduate research office at their chosen HEP to discuss how to apply, the required documents, and English language proficiency requirements.\n*   **Selection Process:**\n    *   Universities (Higher Education Providers - HEPs) are solely responsible for the application, selection, and offer process for RTP scholarships.\n    *   Selection is highly competitive, based on merit and competitive ranking.\n    *   Applications are typically assessed by a central scholarship selection committee or an RTP Scholarship Committee.\n    *   Candidates are ranked based on selection criteria, and scholarships are awarded to the top-ranked applicants, subject to evidence they meet merit-based selection criteria, and confirmation of a qualified supervisor, space, and resources being available.\n    *   HEPs have discretion to apply selection criteria and may prioritise specific cohorts of students, such as those undertaking an HDR for the first time.\n*   **Scholarship Information:** The Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship is a government-funded program that provides block grants to Australian universities. These grants support both domestic and international students undertaking Research Doctorate and Research Masters degrees, aiming to foster high-quality higher degree by research candidates. It operates under the *Commonwealth Scholarships Guidelines (Research) 2017*.\n*   **Timeline Summary:** Application and commencement timelines are entirely university-specific. For some universities, Round 1 applications are for commencements from January through to the end of March of the following year. Current HDR students may commence their scholarships from 1 January. It is crucial for applicants to consult the specific university's postgraduate research office and their RTP scholarship policy for detailed information.",
