Applicants generally need very good grades in a relevant Masters degree. Anecdotal evidence from domestic students suggests a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of 85+ or a perfect/near-perfect GPA is often necessary for successful applications, particularly for highly competitive fields. Selection is based on academic results for prior study and demonstrated research potential. GPA calculation methods may vary by university.\n*   **Required Degree:** Applicants must be undertaking a Higher Degree by Research (HDR), specifically a Research Doctorate or Research Masters degree. This typically requires completion of a degree with a substantial research component (at least 25%), such as an Honours degree or higher, or equivalent international qualifications recognized by Australian tertiary admission authorities.\n\n## Experience Requirements\n\n*   **Minimum Years:** No specific minimum years of experience are stated.\n*   **Accepted Types:** At least six months of relevant supervised research experience with outstanding results (possibly as part of a Masters degree) is considered beneficial, according to unofficial sources.\n\n## Test Requirements\n\n*   **IELTS/TOEFL/Other Language Certificates:** No specific language test requirements are mentioned as part of the RTP scholarship guidelines themselves.

It is funded by the Australian Government and administered by Australian universities to support high-achieving domestic and international research students undertaking Research Doctorate and Research Masters degrees. The RTP Fee Offset component is often automatically offered to all domestic students admitted to a Masters by Research or doctoral degree. This scholarship can be packaged with other tuition scholarships for international students and is available for Joint Research Awards when the Australian university is the home institution.\n*   **Timeline Summary:** The application opening and closing dates for RTP scholarships are determined by individual universities and vary significantly throughout the year.
