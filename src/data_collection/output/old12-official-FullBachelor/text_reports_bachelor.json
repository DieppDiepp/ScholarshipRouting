Scholars are currently majoring in diverse areas such as international studies, natural sciences, journalism, languages, and fine arts. There are no explicit restrictions on the field of study, allowing scholars to pursue their academic interests broadly.\n\n## 6. Academic Requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the program and maintain scholarship support, scholars must meet the following academic requirements:\n\n*   **Required Degree:** Applicants must have graduated from a UWC school (high school diploma) to pursue higher education at the undergraduate level.\n*   **Minimum GPA:** Scholars are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress, which typically means a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. This requirement also applies to transfer students.\n\n## 7. Experience Requirements\n\nThere are no explicitly stated minimum years of experience or specific types of accepted experience required for the Davis UWC Scholars Program. The focus is primarily on academic background from a UWC school and financial need.\n\n## 8. Test Requirements\n\nThe Davis UWC Scholars Program itself does not specify IELTS, TOEFL, or other language certificate requirements. Such requirements would typically be part of the admission process for the individual partner universities to which students apply.\n\n## 9. Additional Requirements\n\nBeyond academic and eligibility criteria, Davis UWC Scholars are expected to embody certain values and fulfill specific obligations:\n\n*   **Academic Progress:** Maintain satisfactory academic progress (GPA of 2.0 or better).\n*   **Cooperation:** Cooperate with requests for information from the Davis UWC Scholars Program.\n*   **Global Mindset:** Be committed to building cross-cultural understanding, fostering relationships, and seeding global networks for international understanding.

Background and Logistics\n\nThe Davis UWC Scholars Program operates on a unique model where there is no separate application process for the scholarship itself. Instead, students apply directly to one of the program's partner universities in the United States. Those who are admitted and subsequently apply for and qualify for need-based financial aid through the university's financial support office are then considered eligible for support from the Davis UWC Scholars Program.\n\nThe program's guiding principles include providing exceptional students with educational opportunities they might not otherwise be able to afford and transforming U.S. collegiate campuses into more globally-engaged spaces where students from all backgrounds benefit from international perspectives. Inquiries about becoming a partner institution can be directed to info@davisuwcscholars.org, though direct inquiries from prospective scholars are typically forwarded to the on-campus DUWCSP Liaison or UWC Counselor at the respective partner institutions. Program forms for existing scholars and partners are available on the official website.",

This program is designed to provide real work experience, develop valuable soft skills, and contribute to the student's overall educational cost. Students graduate with a labor transcript detailing their work experience and skill attainment. This is a unique and integral part of the Berea College experience, distinct from, but complementary to, the financial aid package.\n*   **Other Requirements:** Applicants must demonstrate high academic potential.

Funding Structure\n\n*   **Undergraduate Students:** Stanford is committed to ensuring that all admitted undergraduate students can attend without needing to borrow to meet their demonstrated financial need. Need-based aid is initially awarded from the Stanford Fund, with funds reallocated to named scholarships throughout the academic year.

The Graduate Student Aid Fund offers assistance to a limited number of graduate students facing significant hardship with university fees, such as the Campus Health Service Fee and Cardinal Care Insurance. For specific master's programs, financial support covering the full cost of attendance may be provided for up to 100 students annually. Graduate students whose actual expenses significantly exceed standard allowances can submit documentation for a budget adjustment, potentially increasing their loan eligibility.\n*   **QuestBridge Match Students:** Stanford provides generous financial aid to QuestBridge Match students. For those with parents whose total annual income is below $150,000 and who have typical assets, tuition charges are fully covered through a mix of need-based scholarships, federal/state grants, and/or outside scholarship funds.\n\n### 2.2.
