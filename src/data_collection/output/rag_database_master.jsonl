Gates Cambridge asks academic departments in Cambridge to nominate a small number of eligible applicants who meet all four of the scholarship’s criteria to a very high level. This ensures that those nominated by departments are academically outstanding and are likely to succeed as a postgraduate student at Cambridge and also that they show evidence of meeting Gates Cambridge’s selection criteria. A relatively small number of those who apply for a Gates Cambridge Scholarship are nominated by departments and then invited to interview. All candidates nominated by academic departments are invited to a short interview to assess how they meet all four Gates Cambridge criteria."}

The Gates is unusual because you have to be accepted to the University of Cambridge first before being considered for the scholarship. I knew about the Gates panel interview (which I talk about below), but I didn’t realize I would first have to be interviewed by my potential department so they could determine whether they wanted to put my name forward to a shortlist of serious Gates candidates. Weeks later the Gates Scholarship emailed me saying they had selected me from the pool of candidates put forward by the departments for an interview. Some of the questions, like “what do you know about the Gates Scholarship?” were clearly asked of every candidate."}
