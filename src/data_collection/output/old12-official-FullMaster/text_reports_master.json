This is a critical condition, making them ineligible to apply for a Graduate visa or other visa categories that would allow them to remain in the UK post-study.\n*   **University Applications:** Applicants must apply to three eligible UK university courses and secure at least one unconditional offer from one of these choices by the deadline for references and educational documents.\n\n### Academic Requirements\n\n*   **Required Degree:** Applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree that enables entry onto a postgraduate programme at a UK university.\n*   **Prior Master's Degree:** Applicants are eligible to apply even if they already hold a master's degree.\n*   **Minimum GPA:** No specific minimum GPA is detailed in the provided information, but applicants must meet the academic entry requirements of their chosen UK university courses.\n\n### Work Experience Requirements\n\n*   **Minimum Years:** A minimum of two years' work experience is required, equivalent to 2800 hours.\n*   **Accepted Types:** Eligible work experience can include full-time paid employment, part-time paid employment, voluntary work, and paid or unpaid internships.

    "NL Scholarship (Holland Scholarship)": "# NL Scholarship (Holland Scholarship) - Comprehensive Analytical Report\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe NL Scholarship, formerly known as the Holland Scholarship, is a national scholarship program designed to promote international mobility and attract talented international students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to study in the Netherlands. It is jointly financed by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and numerous Dutch higher education institutions. The scholarship provides a financial contribution of €5,000 towards living costs, typically disbursed in two installments over the academic year. Eligibility is primarily based on nationality (non-EEA), admission to a Bachelor's or Master's program at a participating Dutch institution, and not holding a degree from a Dutch educational institution. Application deadlines vary significantly by university, generally falling between February 1st and May 1st, and applications must be submitted directly through the chosen higher education institution.\n\n## Basic Information\n\n*   **Official Name:** NL Scholarship (Holland Scholarship)\n*   **Provider:** Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, in collaboration with 47 Dutch Higher Education Institutions (both research universities and universities of applied sciences).\n*   **Study Country:** Netherlands\n*   **Purpose:** The scholarship aims to stimulate talented international students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to pursue Bachelor's or Master's degrees in the Netherlands. It also serves to profile Dutch higher education internationally and increase the international mobility of Dutch students studying outside the EEA.\n\n## Funding and Benefits\n\n*   **Funding Amount:** A scholarship of €5,000.\n*   **Disbursement:** Typically disbursed in two installments: €2,500 in the 1st semester and €2,500 in the 2nd semester.\n*   **Covered Expenses:** The scholarship is intended as a contribution to living costs. It is explicitly stated by several institutions that the scholarship does not cover the full costs of living and studying in the Netherlands.\n*   **Duration:** The scholarship is generally for one academic year, aligning with the typical disbursement structure. For study abroad components, it may cover a minimum of 7 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks, requiring a minimum of 15 ECTS.\n*   **Number of Awards:** The number of scholarships awarded varies significantly by institution. Examples include a maximum of 12 scholarships at Radboud University and approximately 30 per semester at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. While one source mentioned approximately 50 \"full scholarships\" annually, this contradicts the widely stated €5,000 amount and the nature of the scholarship as a contribution to living costs, suggesting it may refer to a different program or be an outlier.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\nTo be eligible for the NL Scholarship, applicants must meet the following general criteria:\n\n*   **Nationality:** Must be an international student from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).\n*   **Admission:** Must have applied for and been admitted to a Bachelor's or Master's program at a participating Dutch higher education institution.\n*   **Prior Education:** Must not have a degree from an education institution in the Netherlands.\n*   **Program Type:** The scholarship is for full-time Bachelor's or Master's degree programs.\n*   **Institutional Specifics:** Specific university requirements may apply. For example, Utrecht University requires applicants to have applied for an international Master’s program with a start date of 1 September 2026.\n\n## Field and Program Restrictions\n\n*   **Eligible Fields:** The scholarship is open to students pursuing Bachelor's or Master's programs across various fields of study in the Netherlands.\n*   **Specific Programs:** While broad, some institutions may highlight specific eligible programs (e.g., Master of Music, Music Design at HKU).\n*   **Restrictions:** There are no general restrictions on fields of study beyond being part of an accredited Bachelor's or Master's program at a participating institution.\n\n## Academic and Experience Requirements\n\n*   **Minimum GPA:** A general minimum GPA requirement for the NL Scholarship is not specified in the provided information. However, applicants should be aware that individual universities may have their own academic admission standards, which could include GPA requirements for program entry.\n*   **Required Degree:** For Master's programs, a Bachelor's degree is typically required for university admission. For Bachelor's programs, a secondary education diploma is required. These are standard university admission criteria rather than specific scholarship requirements.\n*   **Experience Requirements:** No specific minimum years or types of professional experience are mandated for the NL Scholarship itself.\n\n## Application Process and Timeline\n\n*   **Application Opening Date:** Applications for the academic year 2026–2027 opened on 1 November 2025.\n*   **Application Deadline:** Deadlines vary significantly by university. Common deadlines are typically either 1 February or 1 May.

The application form must be located and submitted via the institution's website.\n*   **Required Documents:** The primary document is the application form, which is institution-specific. Other documents (e.g., academic transcripts, language certificates, letters of reference) are typically required for university admission and should be prepared as per the university's guidelines.\n*   **Participating Institutions:** A wide range of Dutch research universities and universities of applied sciences participate. Examples of universities of applied sciences include Breda, Fontys, The Hague, Hanze, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, HAN, HKU, HZ, Saxion, and Zuyd.\n\n## Selection Process\n\n*   **Selection Criteria:** If the number of applications exceeds the number of available scholarships at an institution, a selection process will occur. This process is managed by the individual institutions, which will assess applicants based on their academic merit and other criteria.\n*   **Notification:** Applicants are typically informed about the outcome of the NL Scholarship selection in mid-June.\n\n## Key Considerations and Recommendations\n\n*   **University-Specific Requirements:** The most critical aspect of the NL Scholarship application is to thoroughly check the specific requirements, deadlines, and application procedures of the chosen Dutch higher education institution. These can vary significantly.\n*   **Contribution, Not Full Funding:** Applicants should understand that the €5,000 scholarship is a contribution to living costs and does not cover all expenses associated with studying and living in the Netherlands. Additional financial planning is essential.\n*   **Visa and Residence Permit:** Non-EEA students will need to apply for an entry visa and/or residence permit, which is a separate process from the scholarship application but crucial for studying in the Netherlands.\n*   **Talent-Based:** The scholarship is aimed at \"talented international students,\" implying a competitive selection process based on academic excellence and potential.\n\n## Official Resources\n\n*   **Main Information Portal:** https://www.studyinnl.org/finances/nl-scholarship\n*   **Information for Dutch Students (studying outside EEA):** https://www.wilweg.nl/financien/beursopener/nl-scholarship-voorheen-holland-scholarship",
