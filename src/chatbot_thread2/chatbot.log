2025-11-15 17:06:39,196 - [INFO] - (__main__) - Great news! Based on your interest in a full scholarship for a Master's program in Data Science in Europe, with your high GPA and strong leadership skills, I've found a few excellent options for you:

1.  **ETH Zurich Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP)** (Switzerland)
    *   This is a fully funded scholarship covering full study and living costs. Data Science programs are likely to be eligible under their broad Master's degree offerings, which include Computer Science. They specifically look for applicants with "very good results" in their Bachelor's, typically in the top 10% of their cohort (equivalent to a grade A), which aligns with your high GPA. Recipients are also seen as "future leaders".
    *   The application period is typically from **1 November to 30 November**.

2.  **Eiffel Excellence Scholarship** (France)
    *   This prestigious program offers comprehensive financial support for Master's programs. Data Science could fall under the "Mathematics and digital" field within their Science and Techniques domain. While there's no specific GPA, a "high academic ranking" (e.g., top 3-5%) is a decisive factor, fitting your high GPA.
    *   The application launch is typically in **October**, with an official program deadline of **January 8, 2026**, for the 2026-2027 academic year.

3.  **UNIL Master's Grants (Lausanne)** (Switzerland)
    *   This is a fully funded scholarship providing CHF 1,600 per month for living expenses for outstanding international students pursuing Master's degrees. They emphasize "outstanding academic results" and a "very high level" academic record, which matches your high GPA. You would need to check if your specific Data Science program is offered and eligible at UNIL.
    *   The application deadline is typically **November 1, 2025**, for the 2026/2027 academic year.

4.  **Invest Your Talent in Italy (IYT)** (Italy)
    *   This program offers a full scholarship package, including a fee-waiver and subsistence allowance, specifically for English-taught Master's programs. "Data Science" is explicitly listed as an eligible field of study! They also expect applicants to demonstrate "academic excellence" and include a mandatory three-month internship in an Italian company, which could tie into developing leadership and professional skills.
    *   The application period for the 2025-2026 academic year is from **January 23, 2025, to February 24, 2025**.

I recommend visiting the official websites for each scholarship to get the most up-to-date information and specific application instructions for your desired Data Science programs. Good luck with your applications!

2025-11-15 17:06:54,648 - [INFO] - (__main__) - Hello! Based on your interest in a full scholarship for a Bachelor's program in Data Science in Europe, with your high GPA and strong leadership skills, I found two excellent options for you:

1.  **University of Padua International Scholarship** (Italy):
    This is a fully funded scholarship covering full tuition fees and an annual allowance of €8,000. It's open to international students for English-taught Bachelor's or Master's degree programs. While 'Data Science' isn't explicitly listed for Bachelor's, 'Computer Science' is mentioned for Master's, and the scholarship supports a wide array of English-taught programs, making Data Science a likely fit. Your high GPA is a strong asset, as academic excellence is a key selection criterion (minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0 is generally required). The application deadline for the 2025 academic year is **April 17, 2025**, and for the 2026 academic year, it's **November 30, 2025**.

2.  **Bocconi Merit and International Awards** (Italy):
    Specifically, the **Merit Award** within this program offers a full tuition waiver and free accommodation, making it a full scholarship. Bocconi University explicitly lists 'Data Science' as one of its top fields for Bachelor's programs. Your high GPA will be highly beneficial, as the evaluation is primarily based on academic achievement, including GPA, and candidates' academic profiles must be among the top applicants. Your strong leadership skills, if presented in your CV, could also contribute to your personal profile evaluation. The application deadline for Undergraduate Merit Awards for the Academic Year 2026-27 is **November 30, 2025**.

Both of these scholarships are in Italy, a European country, and align well with your academic profile and program interest. I recommend checking their official websites for the most detailed and up-to-date information on eligible programs and specific application requirements.
